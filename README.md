This is an analysis of the COVID patients in the USA based on a public dataset provided by the CDC.

I chose this dataset as it is the largest dataset about this topic. Similarly, I have also implemented a binary classification model to predict
a patient's survival rate from COVID based on serveral factors. I have cleaned the raw data which is then passed to an input function to train the model.
This entire process has been truncated into multiple files to prevent confusions and complications.
